# Contributing to Taskorial

We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github

We use Github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. Please ensure proper functionality of your changes before you create a pull request via manual testing. We hope to eventually build in some unit testing.
3. Once you have opened a pull request, please ensure that all checks pass
- The first set of checks you will see are from Netlify. These check the deployability of your changes. You can view a deploy preview of your pull request by clicking on `details` to the right of the deploy preview check
- The second set of checks you will see are from Deepsource. These check for coding best practices and possible performance issues. If you click on the details of these, you will be presented with a dashboard that shows issues from your pull requests, if any.
- If any of the checks fail, please resolve them accordingly. Send a message to me in the pull request if you run into any issues

## You may also use Gihub issues to propose changes to the codebase

## Any contributions you make will be under the GNU GPLv3 License
